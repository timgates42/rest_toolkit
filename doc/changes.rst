Changelog
=========

0.17 - January 10, 2019
-----------------------

- Fix usage of NotImplemented


0.16 - April 14, 2018
---------------------

- Fix error in handling of JSON validation errors in arrays.


0.15 - April 5, 2018
--------------------

- Do not set content-type header on 204 responses.


0.14 - May 25, 2017
-------------------

- Fix a Pyramid depcreation warning for ``unauthenticated_userid``.


0.13 - August 18, 2016
----------------------

- Preserve response exceptions raised by resource constructors or views if they
  already have a JSON content type.

- Modify default JSON validation error response format: use the field with the
  validation error as key in the response data.

- Use a custom ``rest_toolkit.ext.jsonschema.JSONValidationError`` exception for
  JSON validation errors. This allows for easy customisation of validation error
  response by defining a view for ``JSONValidationError``.


0.12 - June 1, 2016 
-------------------

- Pass extra resource and controller arguments to the underlying ``add_view()``
  calls. This allows using predicates for views.


0.11 - May 6, 2016
------------------

- Allow ``update_from_dict`` to return a custom response, which will be used
  by the default PATCH and PUT views.


0.10 - May 4, 2016
------------------

- Do not require any permssions for OPTIONS requests. This can badly break
  authentication, since OPTIONS will be called to check if auth-related
  headers may be send.

- Do not register catch-all exception view if debugging is enabled.


0.9 - September 20, 2015
------------------------

- Default to not allowing primary key changes for SQLResource objects. This can
  be toggled with a new ``allow_primary_key_change`` variable on the resource
  class.

- Correctly set ``Access-Control-Allow-Methods`` header for resources using
  default views.


0.8 - September 5, 2015
-----------------------

- Correctly handle OPTIONS requests for controllers.

- Do not require any permissions for the generic error view. This fixes any
  errors being converted to forbidden errors on sites with a default
  permission.


0.7 - March 12, 2015
--------------------

- Fix editing of SQL resource.

- Update default views and validation extensions not to assume anything about
  the ``to_dict()`` return format.

- If the ``rest_toolkit.debug`` is set, or the ``REST_TOOLKIT_DEBUG``
  environment variable is set to ``true``, or the pyramid's debug-all flag is
  set the system error exception handler will add the exception traceback to
  the response under a new ``traceback`` key.

- Add basic support for collection resources. These can handle ``POST``
  requests to create child objects.


0.6 - November 4, 2014
----------------------

- Make sure controllers for resource whose path do not end in a slash are
  reachable.  This fixes `issue 12
  <https://github.com/wichert/rest_toolkit/issues/12>`_.

- Fix mismatch between code and documentation: use ``request_method``
  as parameter name for the ``controller`` decorator.


0.5 - October 24, 2014
----------------------

- Allow overriding the request method for controllers. This fixes
  `issue 10 <https://github.com/wichert/rest_toolkit/issues/10>`_.

- Add ``read_permission``, ``update_permission`` and ``delete_permission``
  options to the ``resource`` decorator to set permissions for default views.
  This fixes `issue 8 <https://github.com/wichert/rest_toolkit/issues/8>`_.

- Rely on fixtures provided by pyramid_sqlalchemy for our SQL-related tests.

- Preserve headers when converting a HTTP response to JSON. This fixes
  `issue 6 <https://github.com/wichert/rest_toolkit/issues/6>`_.

- The route name for a resource can now be configured with a ``route_name`` parameter
  for the ``resource`` decorator.


0.4.1 - July 18, 2014
---------------------

- Make sure all raised HTTP exceptions are converted to JSON responses.


0.4 - July 18, 2014
-------------------

This releases focuses on improving the documentation and fixing problems in the
SQL extension.

- Fix several errors in the SQLResource defaults views.

- Configuring the SQL extension is no longer necessary if you use
  `pyramid_sqlalchemy <https://pyramid-sqlalchemy.readthedocs.org>`_ to handle
  SQLAlchemy integration.

- `Travis <https://travis-ci.org/wichert/pyramid_sqlalchemy>`_ is now setup to
  automatically run tests on CPython 2.7, CPython 3.3, CPython 3.4 and PyPy.

- Fix Python 3 compatibility problem in the generic error view.

- Drop explicit Python 2.6 support. The tests use too many set literals to make
  Python 2.6 worthwile.

- Modify EditableResource to not inherit from ViewableResource. This makes
  the separation between editing and viewing explicit, and works around the
  inability of Python to handle the inheritance schemes where a base classes 
  is used multiple times.

- Remove the default value for ``replace`` in
  ``EditableResource.updat_from_dict()``. This did not serve a useful purpose,
  and could be confusing.

- Set ``self.request`` in SQLResource constructor.


0.3 - July 11, 2014
-------------------

This release fixes several critical errors in the SQL extension:

- Fix the invoction of the context query.

- Return not-found error from SQLResource instead of an internal error when no
  SQL row could be found.

- Do not enable default views for SQLResource automatically. This should be
  an explicit decision by the user.


0.2.2 - July 11, 2014
---------------------

- Fix several errors in SQL extension.


0.2.1 - July 10, 2014
---------------------

- Add a MANIFEST.in to the source distribution installable.


0.2 - July 9, 2014
------------------

- Several demos showing how to use rest_toolkit with AngularJS have been added.

- Support for default DELETE, GET, PATCH and PUT views has been added.

- Various documentation fixes and improvements.


0.1 - Released 24 June, 2014
----------------------------

This is the first release.
